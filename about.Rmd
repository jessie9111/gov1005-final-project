## Milestone 4 Update

I have found and cleaned data tables for more than twenty schools on Degrees Awarded by Program in 2018. These tables provide the racial and gender breakdowns within STEM degrees awarded at each school. The schools included are all eight Ivy Leagues as well as the following institutions: 

Boston University,
California Institute of Technology,
University of California, Berkeley,
Carnegie Mellon University,
Duke University,
Georgia Institute of Technology,
Harvey Mudd College,
Johns Hopkins University,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Northwestern University,
Tufts University,
Vanderbilt University,
University of Virginia,
Washington University in St. Louis

## Summary and Goals

This project's goal is to analyze students studying STEM at the university level and to break down and compare racial and gender demographics between highly ranked institutions within the United States. This data is collected from the [American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE)](https://www.asee.org/). 

This investigation hopes to critique the current demographic breakdown of STEM fields and encourage higher institutions to think more about how they can help encourage underrepresented minorities to enter and remain interested in STEM fields. 

So far in my project, I have currently found and cleaned data tables on Degrees Awarded by Program in 2018. These tables provide the racial and gender breakdowns within STEM degrees awarded at each school. 

I would also like to analyze the number of students studying each field in total over a longer time span to see if the racial and gender breakdowns changes significantly over time. 

Additionally, there are tables on the ASEE website that break down each field based on how many students identify as male or female within each race which may be interesting to incorporate in my project. 

Finally, I may consider including data about K-12 STEM programs and career paths in my project in order to analyze if racial and gender breakdowns before and after college are similar.

## The Data

# Wrote a function to scrap all of the tables more efficiently. Function takes
# in a url and scrapes that page for tables using function in the rvest package.

ugrad_degrees_2018 <- function(url) {
  table <- read_html(url) %>% 
    html_nodes("table")

  # Used the rvest package to read the table with racial and gender breakdowns.
  # Removed the "Tot" column in the table and rows with NA values.
  
  table <- table[[2]] %>%
    html_table(fill = TRUE) %>%
    select(-Tot) %>%
    drop_na()
  
  # Used the number of rows to remove the last row of the table (the Totals row)

  cnt = nrow(table)
  
  table <- table[-c(cnt),]
  
  # Removed rows that had all zero values, or no students receiving degrees in a
  # certain field in 2018

  table <- table[!(table$Male==0 & table$Female==0),]

  # Make all columns except the first column numeric
