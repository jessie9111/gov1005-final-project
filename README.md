# Investigating Demographics within Higher Education STEM Programs - Final Project for GOV1005: Data (Spring 2020, Harvard Univerity, taught by David Kane)

This project's goal is to analyze undergraduate students studying engineering at the university level and to break down and compare racial and gender demographics between highly ranked institutions within the United States. 

The project consists of racial and gender breakdowns in undergraduate engineering programs for 20+ elite universities, retention data within Harvard's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and regressions that show the relationship between percentage of minority students in engineering programs versus the total number of students enrolled. 

This investigation hopes to critique the current demographic breakdown of engineering fields and encourage higher institutions to think more about how they can help encourage underrepresented minorities to enter and remain interested in STEM fields.

Data is collected from the [American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE)](https://www.asee.org/).
